Welcome to RecReo, the go-to place for all your recreational needs and information.

In order to see activities, you have a few options. One is to share your location with the program, like so.

You'll then be redirected to a list of activities nearby...

You will see a list of locations, each with their name, types of activities, address, and distance from you.

Along with a short forecast...
and a map of the activities.

You can also filter your activities to narrow your search.

Once you select a page, you can see a more detailed description including distance, address, status, and an ai generated description.

You can also input a location of your choosing and see events and activities elsewhere, like so.

Here is another example of using our filters to find an activity or location that sounds fun for you, and the corresponding page with more detail.
