# CS4300 - HW 1
#### Lucas Estevez

## Initial Setup

### Python

Please ensure you have python installed on your machine.
#### Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Mint
Required: **sudo apt install python3** \
Recommended: **sudo apt install python-is-python3**

### Virtual Environment
You will need to create a virtual environment using the following commands\
python3 -m venv name_of_your_environment\
source name_of_your_environment/bin/activate

### Necessary Packages
Once sourced into your virtual environment, you will need to install packages using pip\
pip install numpy pytest

## Running Code
Once in the homework1 directory (not the subdirectories), execute the following command: \
**python -m pytest** \
I've removed the pycache in order to reduce the size of this repo, however as a result your code may take slightly longer to execute the first time you run it.
